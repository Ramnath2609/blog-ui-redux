# Blog UI
This app is a basic blog post app where we have a list of users and their assosciated posts. There is also comments available for each post. 

# Installing
``` bash
npm install redux 
```
``` bash
npm install axios
```

# Dependencies
* axios
* redux
* react-redux
* bootstrap

# Usage
There are links available for users and posts. Once users are selected a list of users are displayed. Upon selecting one user a list of posts that belong to that particular user will be displayed. In case of posts a list of posts will be displayed and when we click on any particular post it will go on to display the realted information about the post like the author of the post, then the comments made for the post. Since we are making use of redux, there will be no delay in loading pages as we go forward and backward.
